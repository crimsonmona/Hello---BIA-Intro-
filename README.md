# Hello---BIA-Intro-
I am a recent graduate of Tripleten's BIA Program. 

I am a graduate of Montclair State University, where I earned a degree in Communication and Media Arts. In more recent years I have finished the Tripleten Business Analytics course, becoming versed in databases and data visualization programs. Using languages such as SQL and DAX, I've become proficient in weaving a data-based narrative that answers important questions about business operations in a comprehensive manner.  I am pretty well versed in various programs such as Tableau, Power BI and Excel. Over the course of eight years I have had many different roles and work opportunities. I believe that the knowledge I have gained from my diverse background and my love of learning will serve me well in any new venture. During my career I've developed many skills, tenacity and a work ethic that will help me succeed a new role.

Please check out my sample project below where I ran a restaurant analysis for an app called Zomato. In the analysis we breakdown the study of restaurant culture on this application. What makes some of these restaurants so popular, and how does that affect revenue on Zomato? 

Please see the full analysis on the Project Link page in this Repository.
